#Element remover bookmarklet

A script which allows you to remove HTML elements you don't want to see on the page. This can be useful when the site contains a *bad* paywall, stupid ads, cookies and other nonsense that most sites have.

##Usage

Add `element_remmer.js` as a bookmarklet and click it in the toolbar whenever you want to use it.
